# How to Pitch the Customer Support Agent Template

**This document helps you convert interest into clients.**

---

## Your Positioning

You're not selling a "template" - you're selling **transformation of their support operation**.

### Key Messages:

**DON'T say:**
- "I have a Claude template for support"
- "I can set up AI for you"
- "This will make your support faster"

**DO say:**
- "I help companies cut support costs by 40-60% while improving customer satisfaction"
- "I transform support teams from drowning in repetitive questions to focusing on complex customer relationships"
- "I implement AI support systems that work across your entire team in under a day"

---

## The Pitch Framework

### 1. Identify the Pain (30 seconds)

**Question-based approach:**

"Can I ask you a few questions about your support operation?
- What percentage of your tickets are repetitive questions?
- How long does it take to train a new support agent?
- How often do agents give inconsistent answers to the same question?
- What happens when policies change - how do you update everyone?
- What's your average response time for Tier 1 questions?"

**[Let them answer - they'll articulate their own pain]**

**Alternative (Statement approach):**

"Most companies I work with face the same challenges:
- 60-70% of tickets are repetitive questions that agents could answer instantly if they had the right information at their fingertips
- It takes 3-6 months to fully train a new support agent
- Knowledge is siloed - your best agent knows all the edge cases, but that knowledge leaves when they do
- When policies change, you're hoping everyone got the memo

Sound familiar?"

### 2. Show the Transformation (60 seconds)

**Paint the picture:**

"Here's what it looks like after implementation:

**Week 1:** Your support team gets access to an AI assistant that knows every policy, every troubleshooting step, every edge case. When they encounter a question, they ask the AI - instant answer with exact policy citations.

**Week 2:** Instead of searching through documents for 5 minutes, your agents draft responses in 30 seconds. Quality goes up because everyone's using the same excellent language.

**Month 1:** Your CSAT scores improve because responses are faster and more consistent. Your agents are happier because they're solving real problems instead of answering 'what's your return policy' for the 50th time.

**Month 3:** You cut ticket volume by 40% because common questions are handled instantly. Your team can handle 3x more customers without hiring anyone new.

**The best part?** When policies change, you update one document. Every team member instantly has the latest information. No training sessions, no email chains, no confusion."

### 3. Overcome Objections (Know These Cold)

#### Objection: "We're already using [chatbot/helpdesk software]"

**Response:**
"Perfect! This doesn't replace that - it makes your TEAM more effective. Your chatbot handles customers directly. This makes your human agents superhuman. They work together.

Think of it this way: Your chatbot is the front line. When customers reach a human agent, that agent now has an AI assistant that makes them as knowledgeable as your most experienced team member. Your junior agents perform like senior agents from day one."

#### Objection: "How is this different from just using ChatGPT?"

**Response:**
"Great question. Three big differences:

**One:** This is trained on YOUR policies, YOUR knowledge base, YOUR brand voice. ChatGPT doesn't know your 30-day return policy or your shipping rates.

**Two:** Everyone on your team uses the SAME system with the SAME information. No one's getting different answers from different AI tools. Total consistency.

**Three:** When you update your knowledge base, everyone's AI updates instantly. You're not hoping everyone re-prompts ChatGPT with new information.

Plus, it integrates with your workflow - your team isn't copying and pasting between tools."

#### Objection: "What about AI giving wrong answers?"

**Response:**
"That's exactly why I build these with safety rails. The AI I set up for you:

**One:** Only references YOUR verified documentation. It's not making things up from the internet.

**Two:** Cites its sources - when it says 'our return policy allows X,' it tells you which policy document that came from. Your agents can verify.

**Three:** Knows when to escalate. I program it to flag situations that need human judgment - legal threats, safety issues, anything outside documented policies.

**Four:** Your agents are ALWAYS in control. They review every response before sending. The AI is the assistant, humans make final decisions.

Think of it as giving every agent a photographic memory of your documentation, not replacing their judgment."

#### Objection: "This sounds expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's talk ROI. What's one support agent's salary - say $50K/year?

**[Let them confirm]**

If this system saves each agent just 5 hours per week - that's one hour a day on repetitive questions - that's 250 hours per year per agent.

At $25/hour, that's $6,250 in saved time per agent per year.

How many support agents do you have?

**[They answer - do the math]**

So if you have 10 agents, that's $62,500 in productivity gains in year one. And that's being conservative at just one hour per day.

The implementation is [your price], plus Claude subscription at $20-30 per agent per month.

You're positive ROI in [calculate] months."

**Alternative approach (if they're small):**

"The setup is a one-time fee of [your price], then the ongoing cost is just the Claude subscription - $20 per user per month for Pro, or $30 for Teams.

So for a 5-person support team, you're looking at [$100-150/month] after initial setup. That pays for itself if it saves each agent just 2 hours per month."

#### Objection: "Our team won't use it / will resist"

**Response:**
"I hear this concern a lot, and here's what I've found: Support agents LOVE this. 

Why? Because it makes their job easier and makes them look good. They're not worried about AI replacing them - they see it as a tool that lets them focus on interesting problems instead of answering 'where's my order' all day.

The agents who resist are usually scared they'll look bad if they need help. But when the WHOLE team is using it, it becomes normal. Your senior agents use it for edge cases, junior agents use it for learning.

I also include change management in my implementation:
- I train your team leads first - they become champions
- I show quick wins in week one so everyone sees value
- I position it as 'we're empowering you' not 'we're watching you'
- I track metrics that make agents look good (faster response times, higher CSAT)

Within a week, the question isn't 'why should I use this' - it's 'how did we ever work without this?'"

#### Objection: "We need to think about it / discuss internally"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is a decision that should involve your team. Let me make that conversation easier:

I can set up a proof of concept with 2-3 of your team members - no cost, no commitment. They use it for a week on real tickets. Then you have actual data:
- How many tickets did it help with?
- How much time did it save?
- What was the quality of responses?
- Did your agents actually like using it?

You'll have real evidence for your internal discussion instead of hypotheticals. Can we schedule that pilot for next week?"

---

### 4. The Close (Different Options)

#### Close Option A: Pilot Project

"Here's what I suggest: Let's run a 2-week pilot with 3-5 of your support agents.

I'll set up the system with your actual documentation, train your pilot team, and you measure:
- Time saved per ticket
- Response quality
- Agent satisfaction
- Customer satisfaction

If the results aren't compelling, you've lost nothing but two weeks. If they are - and based on my experience they will be - you roll it out to the full team.

I charge [reduced rate] for the pilot, which credits toward full implementation if you proceed.

Can we start next Monday?"

#### Close Option B: Phased Rollout

"I recommend we do this in phases:

**Phase 1 (Week 1):** Set up with your documentation, train 2-3 senior agents, test with real tickets

**Phase 2 (Week 2-3):** Incorporate feedback, expand to full support team, integrate with your workflow

**Phase 3 (Month 2):** Optimize based on usage data, add advanced features like Cowork Mode

**Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Quarterly reviews and knowledge base updates

Total investment: [your price] for setup, then [monthly rate] for ongoing optimization.

You're seeing ROI by week 2. Ready to get started?"

#### Close Option C: Full Implementation

"Based on what you've told me, I think we can transform your support operation in 2 weeks:

**Week 1:** Build and test
- I set up the system with your documentation  
- Train your team leads
- Test with real support scenarios
- Refine based on feedback

**Week 2:** Launch and optimize
- Roll out to full team
- Monitor usage and results
- Make adjustments
- Train on advanced features

**Investment:** [Your price] all-in

After that, you just pay the Claude subscription for your team. I'm available for monthly check-ins and knowledge base updates as needed.

When can we schedule your team training?"
