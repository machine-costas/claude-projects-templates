## How to Escalate

### Step 1: Document Everything

Before escalating, ensure ticket includes:
- **Complete timeline** of customer interactions
- **Customer information:** Name, email, order numbers, account history
- **Issue summary:** Clear description of problem
- **Actions taken:** What you've already tried
- **Customer tone/urgency:** Emotional state, urgency level
- **Supporting evidence:** Screenshots, photos, order details
- **Recommendation:** What you think should be done (if any)

### Step 2: Notify the Customer

**For immediate escalations (Red flags):**
> "I understand this is [serious/urgent]. I'm escalating this to my supervisor right now who will be in touch within [timeframe]. They will have full context of our conversation."

**For priority escalations (Yellow flags):**
> "I want to make sure you get the best resolution. I'm escalating this to [role/team] who has the authority to [specific action]. They'll review your case and respond within [timeframe]."

**For standard escalations (Green flags):**
> "To properly address this, I'm forwarding your request to our [department] team who specializes in [area]. You'll hear back within [timeframe]."

### Step 3: Tag the Ticket

Use these tags in the support system:
- **Priority level:** `immediate`, `priority`, `standard`
- **Category:** `legal`, `safety`, `refund-exception`, `technical`, etc.
- **Escalation type:** `supervisor`, `department`, `senior-agent`
- **Status:** `escalated-pending-response`

### Step 4: Follow Up

- **Red flags:** Check within 30 minutes that supervisor has seen it
- **Yellow flags:** Check within 4 hours for status update
- **Green flags:** Check next business day if no response

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Escalate These:

1. **Standard returns within policy** - Process these yourself
2. **Common technical issues in knowledge base** - Troubleshoot first
3. **Questions you can answer with existing documentation**
4. **Customer is just venting but satisfied with resolution**
5. **Small policy exceptions within your authority**

### ❌ Don't Say These During Escalation:

- ~~"I can't help you, I need to escalate"~~ (Sounds incompetent)
  - ✅ **Instead:** "I want to make sure you get the best solution, so I'm involving..."

- ~~"This is beyond my pay grade"~~ (Sounds dismissive)
  - ✅ **Instead:** "I'm connecting you with someone who has additional authority to..."

- ~~"My manager will probably just say no anyway"~~ (Sets negative expectation)
  - ✅ **Instead:** "Let me escalate this so we can explore all options..."

- ~~"Company policy won't allow that"~~ (Sounds rigid)
  - ✅ **Instead:** "I'm escalating this to see if we can find a solution that works..."

## Escalation Response Times (SLA)

| Priority Level | Escalation Review | Customer Response |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Immediate (Red) | 15 minutes | 2 hours |
| Priority (Yellow) | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Standard (Green) | 4 hours | 24-48 hours |

**If SLA is missed:** Escalate again + notify shift supervisor

---

## After Escalation

### Your Responsibilities:

1. **Monitor the ticket** until resolution
2. **Learn from outcome** - if similar issue arises, you'll know how it was handled
3. **Update knowledge base** if this revealed a gap
4. **Follow up with customer** (if supervisor doesn't) to ensure satisfaction

### Questions to Ask Yourself:

- Could I have resolved this without escalating?
- Did I provide all necessary information for quick resolution?
- What would I do differently next time?
- Should this scenario be added to training/knowledge base?

## Monthly Escalation Review

Track your escalations:
- **Appropriate escalations:** Issues that truly required higher authority
- **Learning opportunities:** Cases where you could have resolved with more knowledge
- **Excellent catches:** Times you correctly identified serious issues early

**Goal:** Reduce unnecessary escalations while maintaining high catch rate for serious issues.
