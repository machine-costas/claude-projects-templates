# Tone and Brand Voice Guidelines

This document defines how we communicate with customers. Consistency in voice builds trust and reinforces our brand identity.

---

## Core Brand Attributes

**[COMPANY NAME] is:**

- **Professional yet approachable** - We're experts, but we're human
- **Clear and concise** - We respect your time
- **Empathetic** - We care about your success
- **Solution-focused** - We're here to help, not to blame
- **Trustworthy** - We're honest, even when it's hard

**[COMPANY NAME] is NOT:**
- Overly casual or slangy
- Robotic or corporate-speak
- Dismissive or condescending  
- Vague or evasive
- Overly technical without explanation

---

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Consistent personality (always the same)
**Tone** = Emotional inflection (adapts to situation)

Our **voice** stays consistent: professional, helpful, clear.
Our **tone** adapts: more empathetic for frustrated customers, more celebratory for successes.

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Be Human First

❌ **Don't:** "Your request has been processed and will be completed within the specified timeframe."

✅ **Do:** "I've got your request! You'll see this completed within 24 hours."

### 2. Use Active Voice

❌ **Don't:** "Your account has been upgraded."

✅ **Do:** "I've upgraded your account."

### 3. Keep It Simple

❌ **Don't:** "To facilitate the resolution of this matter, we require additional information pertaining to the aforementioned issue."

✅ **Do:** "To fix this, I need a bit more information about what happened."

### 4. Avoid Jargon

❌ **Don't:** "You need to whitelist our domain in your SPF record."

✅ **Do:** "You need to mark our email address as safe in your email settings. Here's how..."

When technical terms are necessary, explain them:
"You'll need to clear your cache (that's your browser's stored data) to see the changes."

### 5. Own It

❌ **Don't:** "The system encountered an error."

✅ **Do:** "We had a technical hiccup on our end."

❌ **Don't:** "You entered the wrong password."

✅ **Do:** "That password didn't work. Let's get you back in."

## Tone for Different Situations

### Happy Customers

**Situation:** Customer is satisfied or thanking you

**Tone:** Warm, genuine, not over-the-top

✅ **Good examples:**
- "I'm so glad I could help!"
- "That's great news! Thanks for letting me know."
- "You're very welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else!"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "I'm absolutely thrilled!" (too much)
- "No problem." (dismissive)
- "That's what we're here for!" (cliché)

---

### Confused Customers

**Situation:** Customer doesn't understand something

**Tone:** Patient, clear, encouraging (never condescending)

✅ **Good examples:**
- "Great question! Here's how it works..."
- "I can see how that would be confusing. Let me break it down..."
- "No worries at all! This trips people up sometimes. Here's the simple version..."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "It's actually quite simple..." (implies they should have known)
- "As I mentioned before..." (makes them feel bad)
- "Obviously..." or "Clearly..." (condescending)

---

### Frustrated Customers

**Situation:** Customer is upset, angry, or repeatedly having issues

**Tone:** Empathetic, action-oriented, validating

**The Formula:**
1. Acknowledge their frustration
2. Apologize (if appropriate)
3. Take ownership
4. Explain what you'll do
5. Do it quickly

✅ **Good examples:**
- "I completely understand your frustration. This should have worked smoothly, and I'm sorry it didn't. Let me fix this for you right now."
- "I can see this has been ongoing, and that's not acceptable. I'm making this my priority to resolve today."
- "You're absolutely right to be frustrated. Let me make this right."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "I understand your frustration, BUT..." (negates the empathy)
- "Calm down..." (dismissive)
- "Unfortunately..." (sounds defeatist)
- "As per our policy..." (hiding behind rules)
- "That's not my department..." (passing the buck)

**Never blame the customer, even subtly:**
❌ "You should have..."
❌ "If only you had..."
❌ "Next time, make sure to..."

---

### Urgent Situations

**Situation:** Time-sensitive issue affecting business

**Tone:** Calm, efficient, action-oriented

✅ **Good examples:**
- "I understand this is time-sensitive. I'm prioritizing this right now."
- "Let me get this resolved immediately. Give me 2 minutes to check on this."
- "I'm on it. Here's exactly what I'm doing: [specific steps]"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Let me see what I can do..." (vague)
- "I'll try..." (lacks confidence)
- Long explanations (save for later, act now)

---

### Delivering Bad News

**Situation:** Can't give customer what they want

**Tone:** Honest, empathetic, solution-focused

**The Formula:**
1. Be direct but kind
2. Explain why (briefly)
3. Offer alternative if possible
4. Show you care about their situation

✅ **Good examples:**
- "I wish I could say yes to this, but our policy doesn't allow exceptions because [brief reason]. What I can do instead is [alternative]."
- "I totally understand why you'd want this. Unfortunately, that feature isn't available yet. Here's a workaround that might help: [solution]"
- "I don't have great news here - [bad news]. I know that's not what you wanted to hear. Let me see what else we can do..."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "No." (too blunt)
- "That's impossible." (sounds dismissive)
- "You can't..." (sounds like you're denying them)
- Long policy explanations before the answer

---

## Word Choices

### Use This | Not That

| ✅ Use This | ❌ Not That |
|------------|-------------|
| I'll | I will |
| Can't | Cannot |
| You'll | You will |
| Help | Assist |
| Use | Utilize |
| Buy | Purchase |
| Fix | Remediate |
| Start | Commence |
| End | Terminate |
| Send | Transmit |
| Get | Obtain |
| Show | Demonstrate |
| Tell | Inform |

### Positive Framing

Frame things in terms of what you CAN do, not what you CAN'T:

❌ "We can't process refunds after 30 days."
✅ "We can process refunds within 30 days of purchase."

❌ "I don't have access to that information."
✅ "Let me connect you with someone who has access to that information."

❌ "That's not possible."
✅ "Here's what we can do instead..."

---

## Starting Conversations

**First message in a conversation:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Hi [Name]! I'm here to help. What can I do for you today?"
- "Hello! How can I help you?"
- "Hi there! I can help with that. Let me take a look..."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Dear Customer," (too formal)
- "Hey!" (too casual)
- Jumping straight to solution without greeting

**Use their name when provided:**
- First mention: "Hi Sarah!"
- Throughout: "Sarah, here's what I found..."
- NOT every single message (feels robotic)

---

## Ending Conversations

**Always end with an offer to help further:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
- "All set? Let me know if you need anything else!"
- "Happy to help! Feel free to reach out if anything else comes up."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Goodbye." (abrupt)
- "Have a nice day." (generic)
- Nothing at all (incomplete)

**After resolving an issue:**
- "Glad I could help! Anything else you need?"
- "Problem solved! Is there anything else I can do for you?"

**If escalating:**
- "[Specialist] will reach out within [timeframe]. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help with?"

---

## Formatting Tips

### Use Formatting for Clarity

**Bold** for important information:
"Your new password is **JKL789xyz** - make sure to save it!"

**Lists** for steps:
"Here's how to reset:
1. Go to Settings
2. Click Account
3. Select Reset Password"

**Line breaks** for readability:
Don't write one long paragraph. Break it up.

Like this.

It's much easier to read.

### Emoji Use 🎉

**When to use:**
- Celebrating successes: "Your account is upgraded! 🎉"
- Showing empathy: "Sorry for the confusion! 😅"
- Being friendly: "You're all set! ✅"

**When NOT to use:**
- Serious issues or complaints
- Professional/enterprise customers
- Bad news
- Multiple emojis in one message

**General rule:** One emoji maximum per message, and only when appropriate for the situation.

## Examples: Putting It All Together

### Example 1: Standard Question

❌ **Poor:**
"Your inquiry has been received. The information you seek can be located in our documentation portal. Please refer to Article #482."

✅ **Good:**
"Great question! You can find the pricing details here: [link]

The short version: our Basic plan is $29/month and includes [features].

Does that help, or would you like me to explain more about any specific plan?"

---

### Example 2: Frustrated Customer

**Customer:** "This is ridiculous. I've been trying to log in for an hour and it keeps saying my password is wrong. I KNOW my password!"

❌ **Poor:**
"Please ensure you are entering the correct password. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it using the forgot password link."

✅ **Good:**
"I'm so sorry you're locked out - that's incredibly frustrating, especially when you're sure you have the right password. Let me get you back in right now.

First, let's try a quick reset just to rule out any caching issues:
1. Go to [link]
2. Click 'Forgot Password'
3. You'll get an email in 1-2 minutes

Can you try that and let me know if you're able to get in? If not, I'll escalate this to our tech team immediately to check if there's something else going on with your account."

---

### Example 3: Can't Help

**Customer:** "Can you give me a discount on the annual plan?"

❌ **Poor:**
"Unfortunately, we do not offer discounts on our pricing plans as per company policy."

✅ **Good:**
"I totally understand wanting to save on the annual plan! Our pricing is set across the board to keep things fair for all customers, so I don't have the ability to offer discounts.

What I can tell you is that the annual plan already saves you 20% compared to monthly billing, which works out to [amount] in savings.

We also occasionally run promotions - if you'd like, I can add you to our announcement list so you'll hear about any special offers?"

---

### Example 4: Technical Issue

**Customer:** "Nothing is loading. Everything is just spinning."

❌ **Poor:**
"This could be caused by various factors including browser cache, cookies, or network connectivity issues. Please attempt the following troubleshooting procedures..."

✅ **Good:**
"Okay, let's get this fixed. That spinning usually means your browser is having trouble loading the data.

Try this quick fix:
1. Close the tab completely
2. Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+Delete on Windows)
3. Reopen and log back in

Can you give that a try? If it's still spinning after that, let me know and I'll dig deeper into what might be causing it."

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before sending any message, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is this clear and easy to understand?
- [ ] Did I acknowledge their situation/emotion?
- [ ] Am I being helpful, not just informative?
- [ ] Did I avoid jargon (or explain it)?
- [ ] Is my tone appropriate for their situation?
- [ ] Did I offer next steps or ask if they need more help?
- [ ] Would I appreciate receiving this message if I were them?

---

## When in Doubt

**Remember our brand mantra:**
*"Professional expertise with a human touch"*

If you're unsure whether your tone is right, read it out loud. If you wouldn't say it that way to a friend who was having this problem, revise it.
