## Account & Billing

### How do I update my payment method?

2. Click "Billing" in the left sidebar
3. Select "Payment Methods"
4. Click "Add New Card" or "Edit" next to existing payment method
5. Save changes

You'll receive a confirmation email once the update is complete.

**Note:** Changes take effect immediately for new charges. Any pending charges will still use the previous payment method.

### What is your refund policy?
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all new purchases.

**Eligibility:**
- Request must be made within 30 days of purchase
- Applies to first-time purchases only
- Account must not have violated Terms of Service

**Process:**
1. Contact support with order number
2. Briefly explain reason for refund (helps us improve)
3. Refunds processed within 5-7 business days
4. Funds return via original payment method

**Not eligible for refunds:**
- Purchases older than 30 days
- Renewal/subscription charges (can cancel anytime though)
- Discounted or promotional purchases
- Digital downloads after access has been granted

### How do I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel anytime without penalty.

**Steps:**
1. Go to Account > Subscriptions
2. Click "Manage Subscription"
3. Select "Cancel Subscription"
4. Confirm cancellation

**What happens after cancellation:**
- Access continues until end of current billing period
- No future charges will be made

- You can reactivate anytime and pick up where you left off

**Important:** Deleting your account is different from canceling. Canceling keeps your data; deleting removes it permanently.
