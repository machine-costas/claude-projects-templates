# 5-Minute Setup Video Script

**Title:** "Set Up Your AI Customer Support Agent in 5 Minutes"

**Duration:** ~5 minutes

**Tone:** Friendly, confident, professional but approachable

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Screen: You at desk, Claude.ai visible in background]**

**YOU:**
"Hey! I'm [Your Name], and I help companies transform their customer support with AI. Today I'm going to show you how to set up a complete AI customer support assistant in under 5 minutes using Claude Projects.

By the end of this video, you'll have an AI that can:
- Answer policy questions instantly
- Draft professional customer responses
- Help troubleshoot technical issues
- And know when to escalate complex situations

Let's dive in."

---

## STEP 1: CREATE THE PROJECT (0:20 - 1:00)

**[Screen recording: Claude.ai]**

**YOU:**
"First, go to claude.ai and log in. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for free - though you'll want Pro or Teams for full access.

Click on 'Projects' in the left sidebar, then 'Create Project.'

Name it something clear like 'Customer Support Agent' - this is what your team will see.

Now, here's where the magic happens. I've created custom instructions that turn Claude into an expert support assistant. These instructions tell Claude exactly how to respond to different situations, what tone to use, and when to escalate.

I'm going to share a link in the description where you can download these custom instructions. Just copy them and paste them into this 'Custom Instructions' box.

**[Show pasting instructions]**

Done. That's step one."

---

## STEP 2: UPLOAD KNOWLEDGE BASE (1:00 - 2:00)

**[Screen recording: Uploading files]**

**YOU:**
"Next, we need to give Claude your company knowledge. This is what makes it YOUR support agent, not just a generic AI.

Click 'Add content' and upload these documents - I've included templates that you'll customize:

**[Show uploading each file]**

1. FAQs - your most common customer questions
2. Return and refund policy
3. Shipping policy  
4. Troubleshooting guide
5. Escalation guidelines

Now, these are templates. You'll want to replace them with your actual policies. But even with these templates, Claude will understand the structure and help your team.

The beauty is, whenever your policies change, just update these documents. Every team member instantly has the latest information.

Upload all the files... and we're done with step two."

---

## STEP 3: TEST IT (2:00 - 3:15)

**[Screen recording: Testing queries]**

**YOU:**
"Now let's make sure it works. Let's test it with real support scenarios.

**[Type first query]**

Me: 'Customer wants to return an item after 35 days. Our policy is 30 days. What should I tell them?'

**[Claude responds]**

See how Claude:
- Referenced the specific policy
- Explained this needs escalation
- Drafted a professional response
- Suggested the right approach

**[Type second query]**

Let's try something more complex:

Me: 'Customer is very angry. They received the wrong item twice. They're threatening to post negative reviews. Help me respond.'

**[Claude responds]**

Watch this - Claude:
- Identified the urgency level
- Flagged it for escalation
- Drafted an empathetic response
- Suggested compensation approach
- Gave me internal notes on how to handle it

This is way better than hunting through policy documents or guessing what to say.

**[Type third query]**

One more - technical issue:

Me: 'Customer can't log in. Getting invalid credentials error. What should I troubleshoot?'

**[Claude responds]**

Perfect. Step-by-step troubleshooting guide. This is exactly what your support team needs."

---

## STEP 4: SHARE WITH TEAM (3:15 - 4:00)

**[Screen recording: Sharing Project]**

**YOU:**
"Now you want your whole team to have access. 

Click the share button, add your team members by email, and they'll all have access to this same project with the same knowledge base.

**[Show sharing interface]**

The killer feature? When one person updates the knowledge base, everyone sees the updates immediately. No more outdated information floating around.

For teams using Slack, I've also included a guide on how to integrate this into your Slack workflow. Agents can share Claude insights, collaborate on tough tickets, and learn from each other.

That's in the integration guide in the download."

---

## BONUS: COWORK MODE (4:00 - 4:45)

**[Screen recording: Starting Cowork session]**

**YOU:**
"Quick bonus feature: Cowork Mode.

For really complex situations - angry customers, unusual policy scenarios, difficult conversations - you can use Cowork Mode to work through the problem WITH Claude, not just get a quick answer.

**[Show starting Cowork session]**

Let me show you:

'I have a complex situation - customer claims our product caused damage to their property. They're asking for $500 compensation. Let's think through this together.'

**[Claude asks clarifying questions]**

See how Claude asks questions, helps you think through options, considers different angles? It's like having an expert colleague sitting next to you.

This is especially powerful for training new support reps. They learn the THINKING process, not just scripted responses.

I've included a full guide on Cowork Mode in the download."
